                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of America's most historic areas and home to the Liberty Bell, Independence
                        National Historical Park
                        in
                        Philadelphia is a national treasure.The Liberty Bell, previously called the State House Bell or
                        Old
                        State
                        House Bell, is an iconic symbol of American independence, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
                        Once
                        placed
                        in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House, the bell today is located across the street in
                        the
                        Liberty
                        Bell Center in Independence National Historical Park. The bell was commissioned in 1751 by the
                        Pennsylvania
                        Provincial Assembly from the London firm of Lester and Pack, and was cast with the lettering
                        "Proclaim
                        LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof", a Biblical reference from the
                        Book of
                        Leviticus. The bell first cracked when rung after its arrival in Philadelphia, and was twice
                        recast by
                        local
                        workmen John Pass and John Stow, whose last names appear on the bell. </p>
